# USER_TODO

## Resolved TODOs (from USER_FEEDBACK on 2026-01-22T14:05:00)

## Decisions needed
- After committing the new `.tasks/` plan (and your requested `.gitignore` + `.forge/ledgers/tranquil-quimby.md` change), there are still unrelated deletions and edits: `.codex/skills/*`, `.tickets/*`, `.forge/ledgers/dashing-mackey.md`, `PROMPT.md`, `USER_FEEDBACK.md`, plus untracked `.forge/ledgers/zesty-quimby.md`. Should I restore/ignore them, or include them in a separate commit?
