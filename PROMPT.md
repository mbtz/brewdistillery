# Prompt

We are making a new CLI tool `brewdistillery` which mission is to help users to initalize the necessary Formulae and setup to deploy to Homebrew.

The `PRD.md` decides the design solutions for our tool. Use the `issue-tracking` skill to create tasks and epics to fit the requirements set out in the `PRD.md`.

This is supposed to be written in Rust for performance and reliability.

Be sure to follow the `session-protocol` and `workflow-pattern`

If you need explicit actions from me, write it to `USER_TODO.md` and read my feedback if any in `USER_FEEDBACK.md` if I have answered the TODOs.
