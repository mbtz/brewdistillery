We are making a new CLI tool `brewdistillery` which mission is to help users to initalize the necessary Formulae and setup to deploy to Homebrew.

Use the `$sv-issue-tracking` skill to create tasks and epics to fit the requirements set out in the `PRD.md`.

This is supposed to be written in Rust for performance and reliability.

Be sure to follow the `$session-protocol` and `$workflow-pattern`. If you have changes that you didn't directly make, commit them still, but in a seperate commit as a chore-type.

If you need explicit actions from me, write it to `USER_TODO.md`. Use the `$user-feedback` skill for processing user feedback.

Start implementing tasks. Create new one if a task should be split up into smaller sub-tasks.
